# OpenAI API Configuration
# ========================
# This is a template file showing the required environment variables
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key there

# OpenAI API Key
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# The key should start with "sk-proj-" for newer keys or "sk-" for older keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit the actual .env file to Git (it's in .gitignore)
# - This .env.example template is safe to commit (contains no real keys)
# - Keep your API key secret and never share it publicly
# - If you accidentally expose your key, revoke it immediately at OpenAI
